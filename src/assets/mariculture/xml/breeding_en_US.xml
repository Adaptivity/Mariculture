            <text>Fish produce their droplets and bonus products every so often while living out their lives. Over time, fish will slowly die, and at the end of their lives will turn in to a raw fish which you can use to make Fish Oil, Fish Meal or various other things. Also, when the female fish dies, she will produce a Fish Egg. This fish egg then needs to be placed in to the incubator in order for it to hatch. </text>
