* Fish Sorter added
* Melting System, completely redone ;)
* Void Bottles are now placeable(work like a Void Tank)
* Fish Tank(read chest) Added
* Custom Block textures, are now 'side' based, so the side of the block you click gets the texture(e.g. select top of crafting table with paintbrush, and you'll paint all sides with that texture)
* New GUIs, with Notifications for missing items, and redstone/auto-eject controls
* New Speed, Capacitor, Salinator and Filter Upgrades

====Changes====
* Rewote 95% of things, should a lot less laggy
* Nerfed Calamari(Less Saturation(still more than steak), gives 2 instead of 3 on crafting) and Buffed Fish Fingers (Gives 64).
* Completely removed Limestone Stairs/Slabs, as not needed. Also removed all the molten metals in block form, was it really neccessary?
* Full Dropped BC Power Support, now you can only use RF to Power my machines, and turbines will only provide RF
* Removed ConfigCopier/LegacyLoader > If upgrading from previous version, make sure to load Mariculture on 1.1.4 FIRST
* Oysters are more special ;)
* Scalable melting of damaged items.
* Air Pumps, are now 'tanks'. Instead of passing directly any gas they get to tanks, they now have an internal tank buffer of 8 buckets, which they will then attempt to transfer to the side.
* Right clicking an air pump with an item that rotates blocks such as a wrench will cause it to display, where you need air blocks
* Air Pumps now need larger areas in order to pump, however, Up to 6 Blocks in that area do not have to be air (So you can have ur engines on any side now)
* Air Pumps radius changed: Engine - 40 XZ, 50Y; Manual - 64 XZ: 64Y; Redstone - 25 XZ, 36Y
* No longer auto-outputting to any pipes, use itemducts
* Autofisher now uses more power to work
* Turbine Recipes changed
* Turbines (except manual) now need to be kept supplied with a Rotor, in order to operate
* Sluice no longer has a gui, no longer needs wheels, can no longer take upgrades. However, it's default generation is increased.
* Pressure Vesels, can now store a LOT more per block, however they are much more expensive, but they can also be quite large sizes!
* Feeder Fish Tanks no longer need you to have a certain shape... You just need to have the correct amount of water blocks for the tank size
* Jewelry no longer drops on death(configurable)
* Pressurised Water's range increased from 5 to 16
* Mariculture Enchants will now ONLY work on Jewelry (Removed Magic feather)
* Nerf to Never Hungry ;)
* Story Bookshelves now count as 5 Bookshelves for an Enchantment Table
* Can now right click on the sifter to throw bait in :) (as well as being able to throw it)
* Clicky Click click squiddies with fishing nets :)

* Buffed Fish Oil Drinking
* Air Compressor will now take RF directly, instead of needing to use batteries 
* Due to the new processing system for various things, the recipes for transparent plastic and hard plastic have been reduced to 30 buckets per
* Aluminum and Titanium sheets, are no longer made in rolling machine or with flint and steel, but are now made in the blacksmith's anvil by crushing down their relevant blocks
* Leapfrog changed to an addition instead of a multiplier
* Different fuels, now have a tick time for how long they last in a smelter. Heating upgades no longer speed smelters up, but they will, help machines heat up faster, hyperkinetic upgrades are for speed, ethereal is no longer needed for certain biomes but instead it will make fuels, burn past using up their temperature per piece(but not generate heat, aka it will do what no redstone signal used to do).
* Smelters now will take either solid, or liquid, liquid fuel is pulled from tanks below them
* Bottles now required Heat Resistant Glass(1000mB Quicklime, 16mB Molten Aluminum, 1 Glass Block in a VAT), And they now hold two ingots worth(for ingots)
* Limestone will now generate in any WATER tagged biome, so instead of just rivers, will now also generates in oceans. (But up to a max depth of 45Y)

* Reconfigured Configs (now have a folder for my configs), adding fluids and bait should now be more user friendly too
* Changed Mechanized Sponge recipe to use Water Droplets instead of Aquatic
* Mechanized Sponge, now only requires 5 Sponge to perform it's job, BUT it requires RF to do the work(40 RF per Block) and will use all 5 Sponges. It also has it's range increased from 32 to 48 blocks either side. (Right click a sponge to see how much energy it needs/has used).
* Should now be able to craft Polished Titanium Rods with Tinkers Construct installed(woops!)
* Removed Limestone Stairs/Slabs (existing ones will still exist, if you had kept the old Mariculture config).

==Mariculture 1.1.3 for Minecraft v1.6.X==
* Sluice and Pressure Vessel will now transfer liquids four times as often on it's sides
* Turbines can now provide RF or MJ (Provides RF first, only provides MJ if machine doesn't accept RF)
* Air Pump and Autofisher now primarily accept RF (will still accept MJ, but it's not as efficient).
* Powered air pump can now only be activated every 5 seconds, Uses slightly more power
* Fixed custom blocks becoming corrupted when broken by a hammer
* RF Custom Blocks(Transfer RF, pretty inefficiently though).
* Removed the Recipes for plans. You now need to craft Chalk and a Blank Plan. Then with a blank plan in your inventory right click on the block type you want the plan of. So if you want fence, right click on a fence, this will create a plan of the type fence for you. Halved a plans max uses.
* Added glass to the default dictionary blacklist(would advise you to add it to existing configs, unless you want cheaty clear glass :P)
* Fixed AutoDictionary dropping the ghost items :p

* Blocks that auto-output to pipes will now also output to conduits(conduits take preference over pipes).
* Melting Rutile no longer gives Molten Titanium, but gives the impure form instead. (To stop you just sending molten titanium to a basin :P) Combining this with Magnesium will give you the ingot. (Melting down Titanium will give molten titanium).
* Titanium Tools can be made in a Smeltery, You can also make Titanium as a Magnesium and Impure Titanium Alloy in the Smeltery
* Titanium Rod rennamed to Polished Titanium Rod, If you have Tinkers Construct, you need to use a Titanium Tough Rod and 6500mB of Fish Oil instead of two Polished Sticks and 12 Nuggets of Titanium.

==Mariculture 1.1.2 for Minecraft v1.6.X==
* Paintbrushes(new item id) now take damage(maximum 512 uses) (Your old paintbrushes, will still exist but they will no longer work, you need to craft it with itself to get the newer ones)

* Can now add items to the ore dictionary with my config (helpful for adding things to be converted by the auto dictionary)
* Fixed 'Double Blocks' Class Cast exception when placing incorrectly
* Electric Rays should now actually provide power to air compressor like they should
* Sped up heating of the smelter a little bit more, Should take 15 minutes when in normal biome with full lava to heat up from 0c to 2000c
* Fuel will no longer get used up quicker, but it will still heat up a smelter quicker and continue to 'burn' even when it has reached it's maximum output.
* Applying a redstone signal to a smelter will cause it to 'chew' through it's fuel(to heat up faster) (coal will last 20 seconds), instead of continuing to burn. But with no redstone signal each piece of coal will last 2 minutes, so a stack will last you just over 2 hours. How much 'temperature' each piece of coal gives you does not change. You will still only get 48 degrees per coal.
* Biomes no longer have such a huge impact on the smelter/freezer, but will still affect it
* Purity upgrades now give a full nugget, however, damselfish no longer produce regeneration droplets, therefore you must breed to obtain them.
* Properly changed Silicon Carbide recipe rather than copout :p, it now gives three per recipe, but the heating component recipe now only gives one!
* Removed Magnesium from recipes (except for creating titanium)
* Changed a couple recipes
* Can now user Freezers in the nether if you have two ultimate cooling and an ethereal upgrade (no longer blocking freezers in deserts)
* Switched from Finite Fluids to normal Fluids for Molten forms, so that mystcraft ages no lag...

* Attempted fix in some instances where the sifter would not destroy the item thrown on it. (Please inform me if this is still not fixed)
* Silicon Carbide Recipe now only gives 1 again
* Instead of checking how hard a block is, tanks can now be built out of anything that's material type is glass, iron, wood or stone (as long as they don't have a tile entity)
* Added special case for Aluminum ingots in dictionary converter that will convert ingotAluminum ingots to ingotNaturalAluminum. (Can add your own exceptions in the config)
* Hardcore Diving mode is now off by default
* Auto Dictionary now converts 1 thing per tick by default(changed config name to force people on to this setting).
* Can now use any brown dye for incubator tops
* Coral, Kelp Growth and Kelp Moss spread rate should be a bit faster, there is now config for their speed as well as kelp growth(higher = slower, do not make the number lower than 1).
* Placing coral will now actually place coral instead of kelp.
* Coral and Kelp Forests should generate in overworld if BOP is installed and the gamesetting is vanilla biomes
* Smelter will now pass it's fluid to any tank not just freezers
* Smelters should now heat up quicker! I had accidentally removed the lava bonus woops!
* Purity upgrades in a smelter now give half a nugget worth per purity level(more than before), allowing for up to 2.6* your ores with full max purity upgrades
