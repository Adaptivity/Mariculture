* Different fuels, now have a tick time for how long they last in a smelter. Heating upgades no longer speed smelters up, but they will, help machines heat up faster, hyperkinetic upgrades are for speed, ethereal is no longer needed for certain biomes but instead it will make fuels, burn past using up their temperature per piece(but not generate heat, aka it will do what no redstone signal used to do).
* Smelters now will take either solid, or liquid, liquid fuel is pulled from tanks below them
* Bottles now required Heat Resistant Glass(1000mB Quicklime, 16mB Molten Aluminum, 1 Glass Block in a VAT), And they now hold two ingots worth(for ingots)

* Powered air pump can now only be activated every 5 seconds, Uses slightly more power
* Fixed custom blocks becoming corrupted when broken by a hammer
* RF Custom Blocks(Transfer RF, pretty inefficiently though).
* Removed the Recipes for plans. You now need to craft Chalk and a Blank Plan. Then with a blank plan in your inventory right click on the block type you want the plan of. So if you want fence, right click on a fence, this will create a plan of the type fence for you. Halved a plans max uses.

* Sped up heating of the smelter a little bit more, Should take 15 minutes when in normal biome with full lava to heat up from 0c to 2000c
* Fuel will no longer get used up quicker, but it will still heat up a smelter quicker and continue to 'burn' even when it has reached it's maximum output.
* Applying a redstone signal to a smelter will cause it to 'chew' through it's fuel(to heat up faster) (coal will last 20 seconds), instead of continuing to burn. But with no redstone signal each piece of coal will last 2 minutes, so a stack will last you just over 2 hours. How much 'temperature' each piece of coal gives you does not change. You will still only get 48 degrees per coal.
* Biomes no longer have such a huge impact on the smelter/freezer, but will still affect it

* Hardcore Diving mode is now off by default
* Auto Dictionary now converts 1 thing per tick by default(changed config name to force people on to this setting).
* Can now use any brown dye for incubator tops

* Placing coral will now actually place coral instead of kelp.
* Coral and Kelp Forests should generate in overworld if BOP is installed and the gamesetting is vanilla biomes
* Smelter will now pass it's fluid to any tank not just freezers
* Smelters should now heat up quicker! I had accidentally removed the lava bonus woops!
